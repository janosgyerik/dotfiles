Dotfiles
========
GitHub is really handy to keep my non-private config files
at a place where I can access and edit them anytime.

This repository is intended mostly for myself,
but feel free to poke around and get inspiration
for creating your own configurations.

Btw, I recommend the Git repository of this guy:
https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

He has all kinds of really cool configs, and
enjoys contributions by many followers.
